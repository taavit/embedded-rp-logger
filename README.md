RP2040 based data logger
========================
First attemp with building orientation device collector.
Basically it collects data from lsm303d sensor and stores it to sd card. Storing can be turned on/off on demand. Led indicate whether it's recording or not.

Code is low quality as this is just the very first approach to build "more complete device", and from now on, should be just better.
